# Flowable Challenge

This is a project with a basic Flowable setup, including some test that will fail. 

The goal is to make them pass, following these rules:
- Do not edit properties or xml files.
- Do not modify the asserts.


You can use any IDE, terminal or cloud engine like github codespaces.
